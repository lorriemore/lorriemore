## hello! 🌊

i'm lorrie :>

- 🚆 always fiddling about and learning bits and scraps
- 🧔‍♂️ having a go at [the odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) to learn how to make fun gizmos
- 🐧 also recently switched to using ubuntu on my personal computer so i'm learning how to do bash scripting
- 💸 my day job is on the computer doing R mostly and i'm happy doing that so this is all deeply unserious :)
- 🦉 one day i'll make a computer that's an owl
